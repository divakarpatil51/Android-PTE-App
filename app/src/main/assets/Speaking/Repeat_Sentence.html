<h2>Strategy:</h2>
<ol type="1">

    <li>Try to understand the sentence. To do so, you need to train your short-term memory or
        working memory.
    </li>
    <li> Pay attention to the sentence structure, e.g., if the sentence starts with there or it, or
        if the verb is in active or passive voice. Knowledge of the word order of the main sentence
        structures will help you rebuild the sentence correctly without leaving out words or adding
        in the wrong words.
    </li>
    <li>Pronounce all consonants and vowels clearly, and place word and sentence stress correctly.
        Remember that in English the sentence stress is usually on the last content word or
        important words.
    </li>
