<h2>Strategy:</h2>
<h3>For this item type you need to reply to the question in one or a few words.</h3>

<p>The audio begins to play automatically. You may also see an image.</p>

<p>When the audio finishes, the microphone opens and the recording status box shows “Recording”.
    Speak into the microphone immediately (there is no short tone) and answer the question with one
    or a few words.</p>

<p>You should speak clearly. There is no need to rush.</p>

<p>Finish speaking before the progress bar reaches the end. The word “Recording” changes to
    “Completed”.</p>

<p>You are not able to replay the audio. You are only able to record your response once.</p>
